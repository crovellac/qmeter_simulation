# qmeter_simulation

This is a repository for a simulation of the Liverpool Qmeter device. Its purpose is to train the user of a Liverpool Qmeter on how the system's output will respond to various inputs.

The original simulation was written in Mathcad, a proprietary software. This is an attempt to rewrite the simulation to be open-source and more portable by using Python in combination with CERN's PyROOT library, among other scientific libraries for Python.

#Requirements
Python 2.7 or higher
numpy 9 or higher
scipy 
CERN PyROOT
Python standard library

#Instructions
The main application is main.py. Run this using

python main.py

in the command line.

#Folders
data: Experimental data which is used to build the simulation
mathcad: The Mathcad 15 documents which this simulation is based on.
old: Old, mostly abandoned attempts at additions to the software.
